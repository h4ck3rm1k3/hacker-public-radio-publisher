Sample Show notes

This is an example of some show notes that you might include with an episode of HPR. 
Having good show notes will help other listeners get more information on the topics you discuss in you episode. 
It also helps search engines to associate your show with the topic, as search engines cannot as yet index audio files. 
That said, they are probably working on it. 
The other advantage is that it gives deaf hackers an insight into what your show is about.
