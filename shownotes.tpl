<h1>Sample Show notes</h1>

<p>
This is an example of some show notes that you might include with an episode of HPR. Having good show notes will help other listeners get more information on the topics you discuss in you episode. It also helps search engines to associate your show with the topic, as search engines cannot as yet index audio files. That said, they are probably working on it. The other advantage is that it gives deaf hackers an insight into what your show is about.
</p>

<h2>Plain Text Show notes (Preferred)</h2>
<p>
Please see <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/sample_shownotes.txt">http://hackerpublicradio.org/sample_shownotes.txt</a> for more information.
</p>

<h2>xhtml/html5 Show notes</h2>
<p>
It takes us a lot longer to fix incorrectly formatted html, so please only create html show notes if you know what you are doing and are sure that what you are writing is valid xhtml/html5. Always confirm by pasting into <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a>
</p>
<p>
We accept show notes in very basic HTML format. Don't add any "divs" or "spans" and if you include any javascript your show will be sent to quarantine immediately.<br />
For a HTML Tutorial - (XHTML and HTML5 Compliant) tutorial see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a><br />
Most browsers let you right click and select <em>View Page Source</em>.
</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>
When you include links, we ask you to please use the full link as the link text. The reason for this is that some clients will strip out html formatting but if there is a url it will convert that to a link.<br />
So rather than <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/">Hacker Public Radio</a>, which would be displayed as just "Hacker Public Radio", use:
</p>
<p>
Hacker Public Radio: <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/">http://hackerpublicradio.org/</a>
</p>

<h3>Images</h3>
<p>
Keep images small as people are there are people on low bandwidth caps and slow lines. Don't forget the "alt" tag or our blind hackers won't know what the image is about.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://hackerpublicradio.org/images/hpr_feed_small.png" alt="The HPR Small Logo"  >
</p>

<h3>Displaying Output</h3>
<p>
Use the "pre" tag if you want to display a block of test while keeping the spacing. For example here is the output of top without the pre tag
</p>
<p>
top - 22:15:01 up  4:10,  1 user,  load average: 0.14, 0.13, 0.16
Tasks: 195 total,   1 running, 194 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  1.7 us,  1.7 sy,  0.0 ni, 96.3 id,  0.0 wa,  0.2 hi,  0.1 si,  0.0 st
KiB Mem:   8056388 total,  2315620 used,  5740768 free,   105004 buffers
KiB Swap:  5373948 total,        0 used,  5373948 free,   908576 cached
</p>
<p>
And now the output with the "pre" tag
</p>
<pre>
top - 22:15:01 up  4:10,  1 user,  load average: 0.14, 0.13, 0.16
Tasks: 195 total,   1 running, 194 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%Cpu(s):  1.7 us,  1.7 sy,  0.0 ni, 96.3 id,  0.0 wa,  0.2 hi,  0.1 si,  0.0 st
KiB Mem:   8056388 total,  2315620 used,  5740768 free,   105004 buffers
KiB Swap:  5373948 total,        0 used,  5373948 free,   908576 cached
